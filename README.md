# Computer vision accelerator

Project for a De1-SOC FPGA board that implements a simple computer vision accelerator. The accelerator is capable of performing face detection in real-time using the Viola-Jones algorithm. The Viola-Jones part is currently working, but it is still missing the camera interface. Currently, the 20 frames most likely to contain faces are marked on the screen.
